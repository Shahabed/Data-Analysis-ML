# Description: 
Here we introduce four different classification models for the multiclass classification. These models are implemented in the functions `maxEnt_classifier` representing Maximum entropy model, `random_forest_classifier`, `SVM_classifier` and `naive_bay` which is in fact the naive Bayes model. The common metrics for the evaluation of the classifiers is computed in each function.
