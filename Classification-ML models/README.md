# The goal of the classification:
* Classification of adverse reactions. We want to predict, based on our feature set, what adverse reaction (ADR) or category of adverse reaction each drug result in or belongs to. 
# Introduction:
The first attempt is to binary classify the drug (or chemical compound) based on the feature set, collected from the screening data. The drugâ€™s  possible reactions will be classified in six categories of ADRs, one can predict a drug belongs (or do not belong) to a category of ADR. 
The second approach is to use multiclass classification methods. Here again, we use the six categories of ADR and predict in which category of ADR a drug's reactions might belong.
