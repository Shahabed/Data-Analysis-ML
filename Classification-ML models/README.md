# The goal of the classification:
* Classification of adverse reactions. We want to predict, based on our feature set, what adverse reaction (ADR) or category of adverse reaction each drug results in. 
# Introduction:
The first attempt is to binary classify the drug (or chemical compound) based on the feature set, collected from the screening data. The drugâ€™s  possible reactions will be classified in six categories of ADRs, one can predict a drug belongs (or do not belong) to a category of ADR. 
The second approach is to use multiclass classification methods. Here again, we use the six categories of ADR and predict in which category of ADR a drug's reactions might belong. The description of the multiclass approach is described in a separate README. 

# 1. Classification algorithm_binary
Three functions are defined in this script. The functions `naive_bay`and `Binary_sup_vec_machine`are two classification models that we use here. The function 
`other_eval_methods` is for the additional  evaluation metrics which can be used for the above classification models. These additional metrics give a better insight to the performance of the classifier. The algorithm `additional_functions_for_binary` is also called in for the other useful functions that is used here. 
# 2. Additional  function for the binary classification
The first function is `import_ADRs_list` that can be used to import a list of categorize ADRs which can later be set as a threshold. The function `binary_column` is defined to add a binary column as the label vector based on the ADRs_list. For the spliting of the data to the train/test , the splitting  of the design matrix and the label vector, the `spliting_for_classifier` is defined. Finally, for plotting  the confusion matrix based on different classifiers which is given as input,`plot_confusion_matrix` is provided. 

# 3. manifold_learning
The function `VIF_computation` is developed for the computation of the variance inflation factor. It has a purpose to find high level of multicollinearity between independent variables (the set of features). Four functions, `KPCA_al`,`PCA_al`,`isomap_al`and`local_lin_embed` are defined representing four different manifold learning methods.   

# 4. k_fold_cross_validation
Herein, there is a function `cross_va_scor`that gives a general score of cross- validation for the binary support  vector machine (SVM). the main function is 
`k_fold_cross`, which designed to calculated the classification metrics for each fold.
