# Goals of the project:
* A primary data extraction and basic filtering on FEARS database.
* Computation of important frequencies and selecting the matches between drug and ADRs beyond random reporting.
* Association and matching between FEARS data and screening data, so we can use the ADRs in FEARS database for classification of our screening data.
# Introduction:
Herein, a description of how to implement the series of Algorithems for the advers drug reaction project is given.The first step to start the process, is to run the  "adrs_data_processing.py". The adequet information for this particular algorithm can be found in the corresponding README. The explanation for the computational steps after "adrs_data_processing" follows as:
# 1. Frequency-Based data mining
Frequency data mining is a method used in the Pharmacovigilance. 
Here, we have used a method called Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) as a model for frequency data mining.
PRR is based on simple ratios of counts from a two-by-two table of presence/absence of a drug of interest and an event of interest.
It detects drug-adverse event combinations reported with a frequency that is disproportionately high with respect to some computed baseline.
First, we compute the simple frequencies in the FAERS data which is already prepared and filtered by the adrs_data_processing algorithm. The corresponding function for 
computation of these simple frequencies is `frequencies_calc`. Then we compute the PRR ratio by the `PRR-algorithm` function. 
The Chi-squared value (Ï‡2 with Yates' correction) is also calculated to prove a non-normal distribution in the contingency table. The corresponding function for that is
`chi_squared_algorithm`. These functions, PRR_algorithm and chi_squared_ algorithm, use as an input the simple frequencies computed by `frequencies_calc`.
With the `Adrs_freq_table`, we add these ratios to the dataframe. `filt_Adrs_freq` function, filters the data based on these ratios. 

# 2. Similarity matching algorithm
This algorithm is designed to find the matching pairs between ADR reports in FEARS database and existing compound data used on assays in screening database.
The output is a data frame with information from both above databases where they drug names have matched. Here, we use the python library `jellyfish`. 
This library contains various distances for the computation of difference between two strings. 
The first function, `similarity_distance`, is to customize different definitions of distance between strings in jellyfish, where one can change the distance choices accordingly. 
Two main distance is computed here for the similarity comparison between strings. The first one is jaro_winkler_similarity and the second one is match_rating_comparison.
The later distance,match_rating_comparison, is based on phonetic encoding. In the function `get_similarity_table`,firstly, these two distances are computed.
Then based on some thresholds, these two distances are used to find the best matches between drug names in FEARS database and screening database. Finally, the
distance-based filtered data is produced, including the new columns for these two computed distances.
# 3. Pre-classification analysis
Before going through the classification process, it is desirable to analyze the result that obtained from the association between FEARS and screening databases. 
For that purpose, the ` Pre-classification analysis` algorithm is designed.
