# Introduction:
Herein, a description of how to implement the series of Algorithems for the advers drug reaction project is given.The first step to start the process, is to run the  "adrs_data_processing.py". The adequet information for this particular algorithm can be found in the corresponding README. The explanation for the computational steps after "adrs_data_processing" follows as:
# 1. Frequency-Based data mining

# 2. Similarity matching algorithm

# 3. Pre-classification analysis
