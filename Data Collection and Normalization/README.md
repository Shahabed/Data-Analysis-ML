# Introduction:
# 1.
The first algorithm to run is "Data Collection algorithm.py". This algorithm handles the complex database where the raw data(which is already aggregated) are stored. It collects and combine the separately stored sets of futures. These features-sets are stored separate directory and files based on their barcodes and well-keys. 
# 2.
The normalization algorithm, "run_normalization.py", uses the collected and combined data as its input. The renown Z-score formula is used as a normalization method. 
# 3.
The "function_common" contains a set of function which are called in both above algorithms.
